This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Docker images: a missing requirements.txt file. The initial Dockerfile attempts to install dependencies using pip3, but fails because the requirements.txt file is not present in the context. The solution involves adding the requirements.txt file, ensuring the correct file path, and confirming all dependencies are correctly specified.
